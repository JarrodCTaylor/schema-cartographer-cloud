*Schema Cartographer* provides a means to visualize, navigate, create, edit and share the relationships that exist in your Datomic schema. The UI resides at [https://schema-cartographer.com](https://schema-cartographer.com)

![Clojure CI](https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/schema-cartographer-cloud/workflows/Clojure%20CI/badge.svg)

## Usage

Clone this repository and from a repl in the core namespace evaluate the following:

``` clojure
(def arg-map {:server-type :ion
              :region "us-east-1"
              :system "<<system>>"                     ; <stack-name> also called <system-name>
              :endpoint "<<ClientApiGatewayEndpoint>>" ; ClientApiGatewayEndpoint can be found in the outputs tab of compute stack in cloudformation
              :creds-profile "<<AWS CREDS PROFILE>>"})

(def client (d/client arg-map))
(def conn (d/connect client {:db-name "<<YOUR-DB-NAME>>"}))
(def db (d/db conn))

;; Arguments to the save-explore-schema-edn
;; 1) `db`
;; 2) `path` to save the resulting schema file to
;; 3) `ref-search-limit` This is the number of referenced entities to inspect when creating relationships maps can be `nil` for no limit. If `nil` this could take a LONG time for large databases
(save-explore-schema-edn db "resources/your-systems-schema.edn" 2000000))
```
